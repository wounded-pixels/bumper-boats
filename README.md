Sandbox for experimenting with sensor simulation, track generation and association

## Goals
 * learn some python
 * generate simple data
 * experiment with simulated sensors
 * experiment with filtering, smoothing and associations
 * experiment with autonomous motion - to learn and get more interesting data for the tracker
 
 ## First Steps
 [x] Basics for objects with static behavior    
 [x] Basics for world physics    
 [x] Basic world viewer    
 [x] Basic filter driven associator    
 [ ] Handle dropped tracks - out of bounds or just stops    
 [ ] Better KF - water resistance in model
