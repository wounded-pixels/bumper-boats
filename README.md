Sandbox for experimenting with sensor simulation, track generation and association

## Goals
 * learn some python
 * generate simple data
 * experiment with simulated sensors
 * experiment with filtering, smoothing and associations
 * experiment with autonomous motion - to learn and get more interesting data for the tracker
 
 ## First Steps
 [ ] Basics for objects with static behavior
 [ ] Basics for world physics
 [ ] Basic world viewer (web based?)
 [ ] Basic filter driven associator
